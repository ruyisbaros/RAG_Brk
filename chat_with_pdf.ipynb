    "1. Open a PDF document (you could use almost any PDF here or even a collection of PDFs).\n",
    "2. Format the text of the PDF textbook ready for an embedding model.\n",
    "3. Embed all of the chunks of text in the textbook and turn them into numerical reprentations (embedding) which can store for later.\n",
    "4. Build a retrieval system that uses vector search to find relevant chunk of text based on a query.\n",
    "5. Create a prompt that incorporates the retrieved pieces of text.\n",
    "6. Generate an answer to a query based on the passages of the textbook with an LLM.\n",
